# PARKEI, an amusement park system based on object-oriented programming Design. 
The park contains different types of rides. Transport rides are those that people take for transportation within the park. 
These can be circular or bidirectional Fun rides are the games that people visit the park in order to enjoy. There are different types of fun rides, water rides, ferris wheels, roller coaster, and scare rides.

Amusers are the people who visit PARKEI. The amusers are divided into four different categories based on their ages. Seniors, adults, kids, and babies.
People belonging to each age category are entitled to take specific fun rides. 
For example, adults can take all available fun rides. Babies, on the other hand, can only take ferris wheels.

The whole system is based on the Ride-Amuser relation. Amusers try to board a ride, if it is allowed for their category. If the ride is a transport one, it moves them from a place to another. 
There is a specific set of effects the fun rides exert on amusers on board. Among these are wet, thrilled, scared, . . . etc. 
After a specific number of runs, a ride should go in a maintenance phase. Then, it can not be taken by anybody until back to the working status.
